Q1.)OVERFIT

Q2.)	Metric		Value	Interpretation
	MSE		438.99	Fairly high â†’ large squared errors on average.
	RMSE		20.95	On average, your predictions are ~21 meters off.
	MAPE		120.36%	Very poor accuracy â€” errors are larger than actual 				values.
	RÂ²		0.37	Only 37% of the variance in groundwater levels is 				explained by the model.
The relationship between the selected features (Latitude, Longitude, Well_Depth) and Pre-monsoon_2022 is not strong or not linear.

Q8.) âœ… Best k value found: 1

âœ… Best cross-validation accuracy: 99.56%

âœ… Test set accuracy: 100%

âœ… Confusion Matrix shows no misclassifications for class 0 and only 1 misclassification for class 1.

ðŸ”Ž Inference:
Your model likely exhibits overfitting, because:

k=1 means it's memorizing training data (very low bias, very high variance).

Very high accuracy on the test set is suspicious unless youâ€™ve verified with a completely unseen dataset.

Even one neighbor (k=1) performing almost perfectly suggests low generalizability.
